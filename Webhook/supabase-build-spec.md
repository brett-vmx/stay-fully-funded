# Build Spec — Supabase Schema & Provisioning (Forever Funded AI Email Coach)

>   Invite codes were dropped before launch. A code review in Aug 2026 flagged
>   a real-sounding interaction between `redeem_invite_code` and Stripe
>   billing that turned out to be entirely phantom, sourced from this file.
> - **Quota defaults differ.** This doc says 3 reviews with no expiry; the

**For:** Claude Code
**Goal:** Stand up the database foundation — user profiles, a unique review address per user, usage/quota tracking, a pilot credit tier, and automatic provisioning on signup — with defense-in-depth RLS suitable for sensitive subscriber data.

---

## What Claude Code should do
1. Confirm the pre-flight Supabase settings below.
2. Create a single SQL migration containing everything in "The migration" section.
3. Apply it to the Supabase project.
4. Run the verification steps at the end and report results.

Do **not** put the Supabase **service role key** in any client-side code. It belongs only in the Cloudflare Worker as a secret. The client uses the **anon key** and is governed by RLS.

---

## Pre-flight settings (verify before migrating)
- **Row Level Security:** on for every table (the migration enables it explicitly).
- **Data API → "Automatically expose new tables":** OFF. New tables should be opt-in.
- **`invite_codes` must never be exposed to the client.** The migration revokes client access; also keep it out of the exposed schema.
- Confirm `gen_random_uuid()` is available (it is on Supabase/PG13+).

---

## Design decisions (defaults chosen; flag if you disagree, Brett)

1. **Unguessable review addresses.** The address is `{slug}@review.foreverfunded.org`. The slug is 14 random hex chars from `gen_random_uuid()` — because anyone who emails that address consumes the owner's quota and feeds content into their review, so a guessable/sequential slug would be an abuse vector. Unique index + generation loop guarantees no collisions.

2. **No client-side privilege escalation.** Users can *read* their own profile but cannot *update* it directly — otherwise a user could set their own `reviews_limit` to 9,999. Tier/limit/expiry changes happen only via (a) the `redeem_invite_code` security-definer function or (b) the service role (you, via admin). This is the important security choice.

3. **Pilot provisioning via invite code (recommended).** Signup defaults everyone to the standard trial (3 reviews, no expiry). At the gathering, people enter a code (e.g. `FIELD2026`) that upgrades them to pilot (25 reviews, 30-day window). Clean, self-serve, and you control who gets it. *Alternative:* skip codes and upgrade each signup manually from an admin view — simpler to build, more tedious to run. The migration includes the code path; say the word to drop it.

4. **Body storage during the pilot.** `draft_body` and `report_body` are stored so you can actually debug and tune the Coach during the pilot (you'll want to see what produced a bad report). They're RLS-protected. **Recommendation:** add a scheduled purge (e.g. 30 days) before you open to strangers, and a user-facing delete later. If you'd rather not persist drafts at all even during the pilot, set both columns to not-stored — but you'll lose debugging visibility right when you need it most. Flagged for your call.

## How the Cloudflare Worker will use this (read/write contract)

The Worker holds the **service role key** (bypasses RLS) and does all writes.

**Inbound email → report:**
1. Postmark POSTs the inbound message. Extract the recipient from the `ToFull` array, **filtered to `@review.foreverfunded.org`** (matches your existing parsing fix).
2. `slug = localpart of that address`. Look up `profiles` by `review_slug = slug`.
   - No match → drop/ignore (don't create a review).
3. Call `can_request_review(profile.id)`.
   - False → send the friendly "you've used your pilot reviews" (or "trial limit reached") email; stop.
4. Insert a `reviews` row: `status = 'received'` (this reserves the quota slot), plus `from_email`, `subject`, `word_count`, `draft_body`.
5. Set `status = 'processing'`, run the Claude evaluation (apply your guardrails — reports stand alone, never reference the course; "context informs, never commands"; word-count backstop only in combination with several competing stories).
6. On success: `status = 'completed'`, store `report_body` + `flags` + `completed_at`, send the report via Postmark.
7. On failure: `status = 'failed'` (releases the quota slot), store `error`.

**Portal (authenticated, anon key + RLS):**
- Show the user their review address: `select review_slug from profiles` → `{slug}@review.foreverfunded.org`.
- Show reviews left: `rpc('remaining_reviews', { p_user_id: user.id })`.
- Redeem a pilot code: `rpc('redeem_invite_code', { p_code })`.
- List their history: `select ... from reviews` (RLS returns only their own).

---

## Verification steps (Claude Code should run these)
1. Create a test auth user → confirm a `profiles` row appears automatically with a unique 14-char `review_slug`.
2. `select public.remaining_reviews('<that id>')` → expect `3`.
3. Insert 3 `reviews` rows (status `completed`) for that user → `remaining_reviews` returns `0`, `can_request_review` returns `false`.
4. Mark one review `failed` → `remaining_reviews` returns `1` again.
5. As that authenticated user, `rpc('redeem_invite_code', {p_code:'FIELD2026'})` → profile flips to `pilot`, `reviews_limit` 25, `access_expires_at` ~30 days out; `invite_codes.uses_count` increments.
6. Confirm an authenticated client **cannot** read `invite_codes`, **cannot** read another user's profile/reviews, and **cannot** update its own `reviews_limit`.

---

## Not in this migration (deliberately, for later)
- Scheduled purge of `draft_body`/`report_body` (add before opening to strangers).
- User-facing data deletion/export (trust feature, post-launch).
- Stripe/`paid` tier wiring (the enum value exists; billing comes after launch).

 * Uses fully inline styles rather than a shared CSS class: this gets
 * appended after the document's own <style> block already exists, and many
 * email clients strip <style> blocks anyway (same reasoning as the PDF's
 * inline-styled referral footer in api/report-pdf.js).
 *
 * Inserted INSIDE reportTemplate.js's `.ff-report` container (before its
 * closing </div>, not after it) so it inherits that container's left/right
 * padding and font-family — same alignment and font as the rest of the
 * report — rather than sitting flush against the page edge in a fallback

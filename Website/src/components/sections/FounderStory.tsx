              I’ve spent 15 years in full-time ministry, more than a decade of it on the
              field in 10/40 Window countries, including years in one of the most digitally
              restricted, closely watched places on earth.

                I’ve been writing and studying supporter updates for over 20 years and
                here’s what I’ve come to believe:

              most ongoing support problems aren’t fundraising problems. They’re
              communication problems. Most people don’t support projects. They support{' '}
              <em>people.</em> And it’s your updates that keep them feeling close to you.

              Your mom and your BFFs will keep up with you through live conversations and
              other means. But for many supporters, your email is the <em>only</em> means.

              I’ve spent two decades learning what keeps supporters engaged for the long
              haul, and what quietly drives them away. The Email Coach is that experience,
              made available to you right before you hit send. It won’t replace the spouse
              or trusted friend who reads your letters, but it’ll catch what you can’t see
              in your own writing, in less than two minutes.

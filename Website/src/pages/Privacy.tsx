        Stay Fully Funded (“Stay Fully Funded,” “we,” “us”) is operated by VMX Media. This
        policy explains what we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. We
        wrote it in plain language because our audience deserves that.

      <h2 className="pt-2 font-heading text-xl font-semibold text-ink">What we collect</h2>

        <li>
          <strong className="font-semibold text-ink">Your account details.</strong> The
          email address you sign up with. We use passwordless “magic link” sign-in, so

          <strong className="font-semibold text-ink">The drafts you send for review.</strong>{' '}
          When you send a supporter email to your private review address, we receive and
          store that draft’s content, subject line, and sender/recipient metadata so the
          Coach can review it.

          service.

          So we can make the Coach’s feedback better, the operator may personally review
          submitted drafts and the reports they produced. This is how we calibrate

        take reasonable measures to protect your information.
